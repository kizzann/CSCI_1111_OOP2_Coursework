			JavaFX Listeners Fundamentals

What graphical objects will you use to make this display?
          - I will use buttons for up, down, left and right. I will use a circle to make the ball

 

What listeners will you use?
          -  No listeners were needed

 

How will you check if the circle will stay on the screen?
           - I will check to see if the centerX is greater than the width of the screen, and if so I will not let it pass the screenWidth. Also I will check to see of the centerY is greater than the height of the screen, and I will do the same as centerX and not let it pass the screenHeight.
